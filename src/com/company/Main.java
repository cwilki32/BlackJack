        //Create a class called Card
        //A card should have at least 3 properties: suit, rank, and value
        //Create a new class called Deck
        //Deck should have a public method that “builds” an arraylist of Card objects
        //Assign each Card a Suit (Spades, Clubs, Diamond, and Heart)
        //Assigning each card a Rank (2-10, Jack, Queen, King, Ace)
        //Assigning each card a value to 2-11
        //This should be done to recreate the 52 unique cards in a deck
        //Create a new class called Dealer
        //Dealer should have a method named “deal”, that returns two random Cards and removes them from the deck
        //Dealer should have a method named “hit”, that returns a random single card and removes it from the deck
        //In your main class, deal the user a hand of two cards
        //Display the total of the two card values to the user
        //If the cards equal 21, declare Black Jack and congratulate the user.
        //If the cards are not equal to 21, ask the user to hit (get another card) or stay (take the current score and end the “hand)
        //Allow the user to keep getting cards until their value exceeds 21 or they choose to stay
        //Bonus: Can you figure out a way to handle Aces being worth 1 or 11?
        //Super Bonus: Can you handle the dealer also playing a hand to see who wins with the closest score to 21?
